# ABOUT ME:
Hello there! My name is Yahor Malinouski<br>
As a software engineer with 2 years of experience, I'm excellent in writing clean and efficient Go code. I am eager to learn new technologies and continually improve my skills by staying up-to-date with industry trends. I have had the opportunity to work in both small local teams and large international teams. I have no problem working with widely located teams and can easily avoid timezone glitches.
